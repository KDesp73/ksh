# UI

- The prompt for the shell can be customized. See [Prompt.md](/docs/Prompt.md)

- The Left and Right arrows can be used to move the cursor and type anywhere in within the input field

- Pressing the Up and Down arrows you can scroll through the history. 
In case the input is empty the history is just being looped while skipping duplicate entries.
When there is already text in the field only matching entries are being showed (TODO: matching entries)

- Pressing Tab shows the autocomplete options and continuing pressing it will loop through them (TODO)
